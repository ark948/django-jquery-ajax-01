test project to learn jquery and ajax
admin-admin@example.com-1

using ajax with fetch
using ajax with jquery

post request - done (GET)
refresh button feature - done (POST)
edit button (PUT) - done - (but requires user to manually enter item id)
single item delete (DELETE)
multiple items delete

trying to move js code into their own files
(function declarations in js files, function calls in html files, js includes in base html)

Current problems:
urls and endpoint names are messy.
static files imports are very messy.

routes got very messy, had to write new ones for jquery put and delete
